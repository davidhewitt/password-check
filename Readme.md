# password-check

A simple command-line utility to check a single password against the [Pwned Passwords API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords). Might feel more comfortable to some to have easily-inspectable Rust code over entering your candidate password directly into a webpage.

## Usage

You will need the Rust programming language installed (should work on Rust 1.58 and newer). Simply execute `cargo run`, and then input the password to check when prompted.
